        I have chosen to use the terminology "searching" when the program runs 
        and looks for content/evidence of interest. There are some options that 
        you can use to specify criterias to narrow down your search. These are 
        covered under the <a href="SearchOptions.html">Search Options</a> topic.
        <br />
        <br />
        It should be noted that this program only works on SQLite databases, with 
        the main focus being on Android devices. A pre-requisite is therefore that 
        an image is created and databases are extracted from the image before a 
        search can be initialized.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first thing you need to do is the select the root/parent folder of the 
        extracted databases. By this I mean that the extracted databases is contained 
        in the subfolders of the selected root/parent folder. This is so that one 
        has the ability to select multiple folders at once if needed.                
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Note!</b><br /> 
        A search cannot be initiated if you select the folder containing the database(s). 
        Examples of right and wrong folder selection is displayed below:
        <div id="image">
        <!-- image of selecting correct folder -->
        <img src="Images/correct_folder.jpg" /><br />
        Parent folder selected with subfolders containing SQLite databases.                    
        <br />
        <br />
        <!-- image of selecting wrong folder -->
        <img src="Images/wrong_folder.jpg" /><br />
        No folders were listed since the database folder was selected.
        <!--table containing the navigation buttons-->
        </div>                     
        <br />
        <br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <!--the previous button-->
            <td>
              <form method="" action="Startpage.html">
                <input type="submit" value="Previous">
              </form>
            </td>
            <!--the next button-->
            <td>
              <form method="" action="SearchOptions.html">
                <input type="submit" value="Next">
              </form>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
